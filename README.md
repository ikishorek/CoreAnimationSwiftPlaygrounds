# CoreAnimationSwiftPlaygrounds
Slide deck and playgrounds from this presentation from 360iDev 2016

It's become very easy to simply rely on UIView animations, but there's some great things that you can accomplish by using 
its underlying foundation, CoreAnimation.

In this presentation, and through these playgrounds, I demonstrate how to take advantage of the fast iteration available
in Swift Playgrounds to develop effects that are worthwhile can can elevate you app. Free yourself of the tyranny of the
edit-compile-run cycle, and get some cool (and fun) things happening!

Be sure to open the Assistant View (locked rings) to see the samples in operation.
